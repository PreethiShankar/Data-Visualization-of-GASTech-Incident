<p>We have used TF-IDF to find correlation between different news publication.</br>
    TF-IDF stands for Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency. It is a numerical statistic that reflects the importance of a word in a document corpus.
</br>Goal of using TF-IDF is to identify words that are important in a particular document, relative to all other documents in the corpus.
</br>
    The term frequency (TF) component of TF-IDF measures how frequently a word appears in a document. It is calculated by dividing the number of times a 
    word appears in a document by the total number of words in the document.
    The idea behind this is that words that occur more frequently within a document are likely to be more important.</p>
</br>
<p>We have used TF-IDF algorithm to cluster the news source into 5 different group.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Cluster 1: Across the news sources, the most relevant words are related to the people of Elodis.</li>
    <li>Cluster 2: Across the news sources, the most relevant words are related to the protests in Abila.</li>
    <li>Cluster 3: Across the news sources, the most relevant words are related to the arrest details/protest situations.</li>
    <li>Cluster 4: Across the news sources, the most relevant words are related to the designer drug situation in Abila.</li>
    <li>Cluster 5: Across the news sources, the most relevant words are related to the GasTech and the industry.</li>
</ol>

<p>
    We have used Latent Dichrelet Allocations Algorithm to find similarity between news sources.</br>
    Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a statistical model and unsupervised machine learning algorithm used to 
    discover hidden topics in large collections of texts. 
    The algorithm is based on the assumption that each document in a 
    collection is a mixture of a small number of topics, and each word 
    in a document is associated with a particular topic.
</br>
LDA works by representing documents as a bag of words, where the order of the words is not important. 
It assumes that each document is a mixture of a fixed number of topics, and that each topic is a 
distribution over words. The algorithm tries to learn the topic distribution 
for each document and the word distribution for each topic, by iteratively 
estimating the probability of a word belonging to a particular topic, and 
the probability of a document containing a particular topic.</br>
Using LDA we have clustered news source in 5 group.
<ol>
    <li>Cluster 1, whose primary source is Homeland Illumination, are supporters of the POK.</li>
    <li>Cluster 2, whose primary source is Kronos Star, are against the POK.</li>
    <li>Cluster 3, whose primary source The Abila Post, also leans towards being against the POK however, they're more balanced.</li>
    <li>Cluster 4, whose primary source is International Times, focuses on drug situations in Abila. There are no evident biases.</li>
    <li>Cluster 5, whose primary source is The World, focuses on largely GasTech.</li>
</ol>

<p>We went through the historical documents and drew a
tree chart and understood the organization structure of PoK. From
this, we wrote JS logic to filter the employee records CSV to only
have the people that have either the same full name or last name
as the people of the PoK organization. This is the suspect pool
we started with. Going through mail subjects given to us for the
suspected people we identified, we were able to narrow down to a
few suspicious mails based on few potentially suspicious keywords
such as virus, arise etc. Equipped with this information, we wrote
several JS scripts to filter the data of mail subjects to include the mail
threads of the suspicious people, suspicious subjects and extension
of people if they are on the suspicious mail threads. We crafted
JSON data by utilizing the GASTech organization structure images
provided in the data.</p>
