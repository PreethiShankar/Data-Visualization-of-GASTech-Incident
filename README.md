<h3>Project Description:    </h3>
Our project analyzes GAStech's environmental practices and their potential role in the kidnapping of its employees in January 2014. Despite their successful operations and strong relationship with the Kronos government, there are concerns about GAStech's environmental record, which our analysis aims to investigate.

<h3>Installation  Instructions:  </h3>
<ol>
<li>Open a terminal window on your computer. On Windows, you can open the Command Prompt or PowerShell. On macOS or Linux, you can open the Terminal app.</li>
<li>Navigate to the directory where your website files are stored using the cd command. For example, if your website files are stored in a folder called "my_website" on your Desktop, you can type cd Desktop/my_website.</li>
<li>Once you're in the correct directory, run the command python3 -m http.server. This will start a local web server on your computer.</li>
<li>Open a web browser and navigate to the URL http://localhost:8000. You should see your website running on the local server.</li>
<li>To stop the server, go back to the terminal window and press Ctrl + C.</li>
</ol>

<h3>System requirement:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Your interface and visualization must be D3-based, and use D3.v7. The backend server and data management is up to you (e.g., simple HTTP server, Flask, React, Docker, Node.js, SQL, etc.).</li>
<li>Do NOT upload raw datasets if they are large (>50 MB), as this will fill up our Github organization's space. Also do not use GitHub's LFS. Instead, if your dataset is large, in your readme.md file, detail where/how to download the data and where to place it in your local system's folders so that your project runs correctly. If you have pre-processed data and this derived data is not large, that processed dataset can be safely uploaded to GitHub.</li>
<li>Your system must include at least 6 visualizations.
    <li>One of the implemented visualizations must be an "innovative"view, that is either (a) an extension of an existing visualization type, or (b) a novel visualization type.</li></li>
<li>There must be at least 5 different visualization techniques used.
    <li>3 bars charts = 1 technique.</li>
    <li>Variants of a visualization count as the same technique. For example, the following are all under the "bar chart" umbrella: bar chart, stacked bar chart, radial bar chart, histogram, diverging bar chart, normalized bar chart, grouped bar chart, bar chart with annotations or glyphs on top, isotype chart, and so on.</li></li>
<li>Visualizations should be coordinated and linked via direct interactions (not via UI widgets in a control panel). For example, a click/hover/lasso/selection on one view must trigger a change in a different view.</li>
<li>There must be at least 3 UI widgets that allow the user to filter the data or update certain views interactively.
    <li>Drop downs, radio buttons, range sliders, check box lists, calendar, etc.</li></li>

<li>A tooltip is required in at least 3 of the views, which is shown when the user hovers over data points.</li>
<li>The suggested organization for this project is either as a visual dashboard, where all views are shown together on a page (scrolling may be required) or in a tabbed view, where the user tabs between different views. If you choose the latter option, think carefully about how you will fulfill the above requirements (connected views, etc.)</li>
<li>Your interface  should be as self-explanatory as possible. Where necessary, axes, legends, etc. should be used.</li>
<li>Your project should be efficiently interactive (ie, able to retrieve data quickly) and styled appropriately.  
    <ol><li>CSS frameworks such as Bootstrap and JavaScript libraries such as jQuery, leaflet.s, and moment.js are allowed, but you must use D3 to implement your charts. Libraries the "simplify" D3, such as NVD3, Vega-Lite, Highcharts, etc., are not allowed.
