    This visual investigation is based on <a href="https://vast-challenge.github.io/2021/MC1.html">VAST 
        Challenge 2021 - The Kronos Incident Mini Challenge 1</a>. 
        The overview of the challenge is as below:
        In the roughly twenty years that Tethys-based 
        GAStech has been operating a natural gas production site in 
        the island country of Kronos, it has produced remarkable 
        profits and developed strong relationships with the government 
        of Kronos. However, GAStech has not been as successful in 
        demonstrating environmental stewardship.
        In January, 2014, the leaders of GAStech are celebrating their 
        new-found fortune as a result of the initial public offering of 
        their very successful company. In the midst of this celebration, 
        several employees of GAStech go missing. An organization known as 
        the Protectors of Kronos (POK) is suspected in the disappearances.
        
        It is January 21, 2014, and as an expert in visual analytics, 
        you have been tasked with helping people understand the complex 
        relationships among people and organizations that may have 
        contributed to these events.

    <h3 class="bg-dark text-white py-2 text-center" style="border-radius: 30px 30px 30px 30px;">Tasks and Questions:</h3>
    <p> <strong>  Mini-Challenge 1</strong> looks at the relationships and conditions that led up to 
        the kidnapping. As an analyst, you have a set of current and historical 
        news reports at your disposal, as well as resumes of numerous GAStech 
        employees and email headers from two weeks of internal GAStech company email. 
        Can you identify the complex relationships among all of these people and 
        organizations?

        Use visual analytics to analyze the available data and develop responses to the questions below. In addition, prepare a video that shows how you used visual analytics to solve the challenge. Submission instructions are available on the VAST Challenge 2014: Submission Instructions page. Entry forms are available for download below.
        <ol>
        <li>Characterize the news data sources provided. Which are primary sources and which are derivative sources? What are the relationships between the primary and derivative sources? Please limit your answer to 8 images and 300 words.
        </li>
        <li>Characterize any biases you identify in these news sources, with respect to their representation of specific people, places, and events. Give examples. Please limit your answer to 6 images and 500 words.
        </li>
        <li>Given the data sources provided, use visual analytics to identify potential official and unofficial relationships among GASTech, POK, the APA, and Government. Include both personal relationships and shared goals and objectives. Provide evidence for these relationships. Please limit your answer to 6 images and 400 words.
        </li>
        <li>If you solved this mini-challenge in 2014, how did you approach it differently this year?

    <h3 class="bg-dark text-white py-2 text-center" style="border-radius: 30px 30px 30px 30px;">Things to consider for visual analytics</h3>
    There are several important things to consider during visual analytics, including:
    <ol>
<li>Data quality: Ensure that the data being used is accurate, complete, and relevant to the analysis being conducted. Data quality is crucial for the success of any visual analytics project.
</li>
<li>Audience: Consider who the audience is for the visual analytics and tailor the visualizations accordingly. For example, if the audience is a group of executives, the visualizations should focus on high-level insights and be easy to interpret.
</li>
<li>Context: Understand the context in which the data was collected and the analysis is being conducted. This can help to avoid misinterpretations and ensure that the visualizations provide meaningful insights.
</li>
<li>Visualization techniques: Choose appropriate visualization techniques that best represent the data and insights being analyzed. Different types of data require different types of visualizations.
</li>
<li>Interpretation: Be careful when interpreting the data and avoid jumping to conclusions. The visualizations should be used to support analysis and insights, not to prove preconceived notions.
</li>
<li>Iteration: Visual analytics is an iterative process, so it is important to be open to making changes and refining the analysis as new insights are discovered.
</li>
<li>Ethical considerations: Ensure that the data being used is collected and used in an ethical manner. This includes protecting the privacy of individuals whose data is being analyzed and avoiding biased or discriminatory analysis.
